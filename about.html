		<h1 id="about-header">About this Project</h1>

		<p id="about-text">
			This project is made by Dominique Goncalves. It is a step towards an idea of building generative websites and making them have similar aesthetics to sites like Squarespace. My goal is to be able to have users/public upload photos and information and then my code and site will build them their own artist website with a click of a button. I think everyone should be able to showcase their work and even though Squarespace and similar sites make it easy to make a website, this is even easier - even though it completley limits the look of the website.
